# Contributing

First of all, thank you very much for your help. I really appreciate it! ❤️

Before contributing, please take note of the following guidelines:

1. Use Conventional Commits

   This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Ensure your commit messages follow this format.
   For example: `fix: correct typo in intro` or `feat: add new dashboard feature.`

2. Issues before PRs

   Before submitting any pull request (PR), please open an issue describing the feature you want to add or the problem you aim to solve.
   Don't forget to assign your PR to the issue.

3. Write Tests

   To maintain code quality and prevent regressions, please accompany your contributions with relevant tests.
   Ensure your tests cover expected scenarios, as well as any potential edge cases.

4. Code Quality

   Ensure your code is clean, readable, and adheres to the existing style and structure. This makes it easier for maintainers to merge and for others to understand.
   An automated formatter is available (`yarn format`).
